-- 10. You're tasked with giving more contextual information to rail stops to fill the `stop_desc` field in a GTFS feed. 
-- Using any of the data sets above, PostGIS functions (e.g., `ST_Distance`, `ST_Azimuth`, etc.), and PostgreSQL string functions, 
-- build a description (alias as `stop_desc`) for each stop. Feel free to supplement with other datasets 
-- (must provide link to data used so it's reproducible), and other methods of describing the relationships. 
-- PostgreSQL's `CASE` statements may be helpful for some operations.

--   **Structure:**
--   ```sql
--   (
--       stop_id integer,
--       stop_name text,
--       stop_desc text,
--       stop_lon double precision,
--       stop_lat double precision
--   )
--   ```

-- As an example, your `stop_desc` for a station stop may be something like "37 meters NE of 1234 Market St" 
-- (that's only an example, feel free to be creative, silly, descriptive, etc.)
--   **Tip when experimenting:** Use subqueries to limit your query to just a few rows to keep query times faster. 
-- Once your query is giving you answers you want, scale it up. E.g., instead of `FROM tablename`, 
-- use `FROM (SELECT * FROM tablename limit 10) as t`.
