/* 8. With a query, find out how many census block groups Penn's main 
campus fully contains. Discuss which dataset you chose for defining 
Penn's campus.

I chose to use the file from Open Data Philly because it was easy to find. 
I tried searching across UPenn's website but I couldn't find anything. I did 
find a (sadly inactive) GIS club hosted out of one of the libraries, which cool to see. 
But it wasn't easy to get this information from the school and frankly, that shouldn't be the case.

Also I wasn't sure what was meant by Penn's main campus? If you meant a contiguous space then, 
I don't think my code is sufficient.
